## Important Note
! This is a work in progress!  Don't clone this and exepct to be able to execute the install.sh file with any positive result. !

My personal dotfiles collection.  Use with caution as these may break your configuration. **NOTE**: Of course merely cloning this repository won't cause any issues unless you clone it directly to your home folder.

### Getting Started
To utilize these dotfiles you can follow these reasonably easy steps:
 1. Clone this repository. 
 2. Review **install.sh**. You don't execute random scripts from the internet without checking them first, right? :>
 3. Execute **install.sh**.
 
 The **install.sh** script will first back up the usual files by moving them to the .dotfiles directory and adding **.backup** to the end of the file name.  Next it will deploy the files in this repository to the expected location.
